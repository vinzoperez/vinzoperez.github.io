    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Vinzo! I’m currently a Freshman at a Community College, pursuing a major in Computer Science. I’ve always had a deep passion for technology, which has naturally led me to explore different facets of programming, game development, and web development.</p>
    <p>I’ve been fascinated by computers and coding ever since I was young. The experience of playing games captivated me early on, and it wasn’t long before I wanted to go beyond just playing—I started modding games, which led me to dive into coding. I began learning how to develop games on platforms like Roblox and Unity, and this hands-on experience gave my heart a good feeling for creating and building.</p>
    <p>My journey into coding started with Roblox. I began by developing simple games, but as I worked on a game my brother requested, I wrote my own code to bring it to life. That project marked a turning point for me, guiding me toward a deeper interest in Information Technology and computer science as a whole. From there, I’ve expanded my skills and knowledge in various areas like game development, web development, and problem-solving in programming.</p>
    <p>Although I don’t consider myself an expert yet, I am comfortable with my skills as an intermediate programmer and have a strong foundation in IT. I continue to learn and grow with each project I take on, and I’m always excited to explore new areas of technology.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy building websites, creating small games, and engaging in coding projects. I’m always curious and ready to experiment with new technologies or dive into learning something new.</p>
    <p>As I continue my studies and career path, I hope to expand my skill set, gain practical experience, and eventually contribute to larger software projects. I believe curiosity is one of the greatest secrets of happiness, and I’ll continue to let that drive me as I move forward in the world of technology.</p>
